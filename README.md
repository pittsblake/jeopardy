#Project Description

The goal of this project was to make a fully functional game that replicates the Jeopardy on TV. I made 5 categories with 5 rows of points values for each category. Each point value is a button that will generate a multiple choice question for the user to answer. Depending on whether the user answers correctly or incorrectly, Score will update accordingly. Either adding or subtracting the point value of their choice. The game is over when the user has attempted every point category.

#version 2
In version 2 I would like to add a time feature. So the user has a specific amount of time to answer as many questions as he/she can. When the time is up, Final Jeopardy appears and the user can wager the amount of points they have for more points. This would allow an extra challenge component as the user would be racing against time. 

I would also like to add the possibilty of retrieving different questions each time you play. This would allow the game to be re-playable as the user could get a different question each time.
